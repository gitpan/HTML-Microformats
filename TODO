* Documentation is pretty sketchy.

* More test cases.

* AUTOLOADed get methods:

	- document them better

		+ can auto-generate much docs using ->format_signature 

	- ensure they can be called as get_X and get_Y where X is the microformat
          class/rel name, and Y is the hash key from ->data which sometimes differ.

		+ make sure any such differences are clearly documented
